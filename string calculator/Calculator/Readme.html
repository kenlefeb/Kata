    <h2>Before you start:</h2>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Try not to read ahead.</li>
        <li>Do one task at a time.&nbsp;The trick is to learn to work incrementally.</li>
        <li>Make sure you only test for<strong> correct inputs</strong>. there is no need to 
            test for invalid inputs for this kata</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        &nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        <strong>String Calculator</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a simple String calculator with a method <strong>int Add(string numbers)</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty 
                    string it will return 0) for example<strong> “” or “1” or “1,2”</strong></li>
                <li>Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two 
                    numbers</li>
                <li>Remember to solve things as simply as possible so that you force yourself to 
                    write tests you did not think about</li>
                <li>Remember to refactor after each passing test</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers</li>
        <li>Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
            <ol>
                <li>the following input is ok:&nbsp; “1\n2,3”&nbsp; (will equal 6)</li>
                <li>the following input is NOT&nbsp;ok:&nbsp; “1,\n” (not need to prove it - just clarifying)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <ol>
                <strong>Support different delimiters </strong>
                <li>to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line 
                    that looks like this:&nbsp;&nbsp; “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” 
                    should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ . </li>
                <li>the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not 
            allowed” - and the negative that was passed.if there are multiple negatives, 
            show all of them in the exception message
            <hr />
            <strong>stop here if you are a beginner</strong>. Continue if you can finish the 
            steps so far in less than 30 minutes.
            <hr />
        </li>
        <li>Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001 &nbsp;= 2</li>
        <li>Delimiters can be of any length with the following format:&nbsp; “//[delimiter]\n” 
            for example: “//[***]\n1***2***3” should return 6</li>
        <li>Allow multiple delimiters like this:&nbsp; “//[delim1][delim2]\n” for example 
            “//[*][%]\n1*2%3” should return 6.</li>
        <li>make sure you can also handle multiple delimiters with length longer than one 
            char</li>
    </ol>
